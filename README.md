# The Game Show host Problem
from the movie [21 (2008)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478087/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_31),
> We're gonna call this
> the game show host problem, all right?
> 
>   
> Ben, suppose you're on a game show.
> 
>   
> And you are given a chance to choose
> from three different doors, all right?
> 
>   
> Now, behind one of the doors is a new car.
> Behind the other two, goats.
> 
>   
> Which door would you choose, Ben?
> 
>   
> Door number one?
> 
>   
> Door number one.
> Ben chooses door number one.
> 
>   
> All right, now, the game show host,
> 
>   
> who, by the way,
> knows what's behind all the other doors,
> 
>   
> decides to open another door.
> Let's say he chooses door number three.
> 
>   
> Behind which sits a goat. Now...
> 
>   
> Ben, game show host comes up to you.
> 
>   
> He says, "Ben, do you want to stay
> with door number one
> 
>   
> "or go with door number two?"
> 
>   
> Now, is it in your interest
> to switch your choice?
> 
>   
> - Yeah.
> - Well, wait.
> 
>   
> Remember, the host knows where the car is
> 
>   
> so how do you know
> he's not playing a trick on you?
> 
>   
> Trying to use reverse psychology
> to get you to pick a goat?
> 
>   
> Well, I wouldn't really care.
> I mean, my answer's based on statistics.
> 
>   
> Based on variable change.
> 
>   
> Variable change?
> But he just asked you a simple question.
> 
>   
> Yeah, which changed everything.
> 
>   
> Enlighten us.
> 
>   
> Well, when I was originally
> asked to choose a door,
> 
>   
> I had a 33.3% chance of choosing right.
> 
>   
> But after he opens one of the doors
> and then re-offers me the choice,
> 
>   
> it's now 66.7% if I choose to switch.
> 
>   
> So, yeah, I'll take door number two,
> and thank you for that extra 33.3%.
> 
>   
> Exactly. "

This is just a Python simulation to compare
the random picking strategy with the strategy
proposed in this [dialog of the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DMnAAvakh0).
